2009-10-15  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.15.

	ABYSS:
	* New options, -e, --erode and -E, --erode-strand.
	The parameter e erodes bases at the ends of blunt contigs with
	coverage less than the specified threshold.
	The parameter E erodes bases at the ends of blunt contigs with
	coverage less than the specified threshold on either strand.
	* New feature. If the parameters e and c are not specified,
	attempt to choose appropriate values based on the observed k-mer
	coverage. This feature will work best for higher coverage data.
	For lower coverage data, setting e=c=2 is reasonable.
	* New option, --trim-masked. Removed masked (lower case) sequence
	at the beginning and end of the read. Disable with
	--no-trim-masked.
	* The read length, l, is an optional parameter. If the read length
	is specified, the trim parameter, t, will default to 6*(l-k+1), as
	before. If the read length is not specified, t will be set to the
	same value as k. For longer reads or when k is less than 85% of l,
	it should not be necessary to specify l. The parameter t may be
	specified directly if desired.

	DistanceEst:
	* Bug fix. The standard deviation could be calculated incorrectly
	for larger numbers, particularly for libraries with large fragment
	sizes. Thanks to Tony Raymond.

	Overlap:
	* Bug fix. If Overlap found mate pairs on the same contig with
	incorrect orientation, it would generate a misassembled contig.
	These misassembled contigs are easily identified in the
	xxx-3-overlap.fa file. The two contigs IDs, in the fourth and
	fifth column, will be identical.
	* New option, --mask-repeat. If two contigs are joined by mate
	pairs and are found to overlap by a simple repeat so that the
	exact number of the repeat is unknown, join the contigs estimating
	the number of the repeat, and mask (lower case) the repeat
	sequence. This feature is disabled by default.

	abyss-pe:
	* Use gunzip -c rather than zcat for portability.

	configure:
	* New option, --enable-mpich. Use the MPICH2 MPI library.

2009-09-08  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.14.
	* Read files compressed with xzip (.xz) and compress (.Z).

	abyss-pe:
	* Assemble multiple libraries with different fragment sizes.
	* New manual page.

	ABYSS:
	* Don't necessarily discard reads that contain an N. Keep those
	k-mer that do not contain an N.

	ABYSS-P:
	* Serially renumber the contigs output by ABYSS-P using awk.

2009-08-26  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.13.
	* Read files compressed with gzip (.gz) or bzip2 (.bz2).

	ABYSS-P:
	* Bug fix. Fix a race condition in the erosion algorithm.

2009-08-18  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.12.

	abyss-pe:
	* Both ABYSS and KAligner are run only once per assembly, which
	speeds up the paired-end assembly by nearly a factor of two.
	* The k-mer coverage information is correct in every contig file.
	* A new parameter, cs, converts colour-space contigs to nucleotide
	contigs using Consensus.
	* A new parameter, ABYSS_OPTIONS, may be used to disable chastity
	filtering by specifying ABYSS_OPTIONS=--no-chastity.

	ABYSS:
	* Read files in export format, which is similar to qseq format.
	* Discard reads that failed the chastity filter. Use the
	--no-chastity option to retain these unchaste reads. Chastity
	filtering affects only qseq- and export formatted-files.
	* Remove low-coverage contigs within ABYSS rather than filtering
	using awk and reassembling.
	* Support big-endian architecture machines.

	KAligner:
	* A new option, -m or --multimap, specifies that a duplicate k-mer
	may be seen in the target sequence. By default, every k-mer in the
	target sequence must be unique.
	* A new option, --seq, prints the read sequence of each alignment.

	Overlap:
	* A new option, --scaffold, fills the gap between two blunt
	contigs with Ns. This feature is disabled by default.

	Consensus:
	* Call the consensus sequence for each contig based on the
	alignment of reads to contigs.
	* Convert colour-space contigs to nucleotide contigs.
	* Written by Tony Raymond.

2009-07-21  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.11.
	* Assemble colour-space reads. Read identifiers must be named with
	the suffixes F3 and R3.
	* Read files in qseq format. Thanks to Tony Raymond (tgr).
	* Prevent misassemblies mediated by tandem segmental duplications.
	A sequence XRRY, where R is a repeat sequence, could have been
	misassembled as XRY. (tgr)

	abyss-pe:
	* Integrate with Sun Grid Engine (SGE). A parallel, paired-end
	assembly can be run with a single qsub command. The parameters
	lib, np and k default to the qsub environment variables JOB_NAME
	(qsub -N), NSLOTS (qsub -pe) and SGE_TASK_ID (qsub -t)
	respectively.
	* The .pair file, the largest intermediate file, is now gzipped.

	ABYSS-P:
	* Bug fix. At k=19, k-mer would be distributed to even-numbered
	processes only.

	KAligner:
	* Multithreaded. The -j, --threads option specifies the number of
	threads to use. The order in which the alignments are output will
	vary from run to run, but the alignments are deterministic and
	will not vary. Each thread reads and aligns one file, so the reads
	must be in more than one file to use this feature. (tgr)

2009-06-18  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.10.

	abyss-pe:
	* Start an MPI ABySS assembly if the np option is specified.

	ABYSS:
	* For a non-parallel assembly, allocate more hash buckets to allow
	for large single-machine jobs.
	* Print the hash load during the loading process.

	KAligner:
	* Output the IDs of reads that do not align.
	* Print a progress report of the number of reads aligned.

	ParseAligns:
	* To reduce memory usage, do not track reads that did not align.
	KAligner and ParseAligns should now be able to handle any number
	of reads in a single run.

	MergePaths:
	* Number paired-end contigs so that their IDs do not overlap with
	the single-end contigs. If a single-end contig is not used in a
	paired-end contig, its ID will not change.
	* Merge overlapping paired-end contigs that were previously
	being missed in some situations.

	configure:
	* Print a warning if Google sparsehash was not found.

2009-05-15  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.9.

	abyss-pe:
	* Allow multiple input files specified by the parameter `in'.
	* Support reading FASTA or FASTQ file formats.

	KAligner:
	* Support using Google sparsehash to reduce memory usage.
	Google sparsehash does not provide a multimap, so KAligner built
	using Google sparsehash cannot handle a duplicate k-mer in the
	reference sequence. It will print an error message and die if a
	duplicate k-mer is encountered. If Google sparsehash is not used,
	the standard STL multimap will be used which does permit duplicate
	k-mer.
	* Support reading the query sequence from standard input.

	ParseAligns:
	* Significantly reduce memory usage if the mate reads are
	encountered one after the next in the same file.

2009-04-02  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.8.
	* Bug fix. Fix the undefined behaviour causing the error
	Assertion `marked == split' failed.

2009-03-31  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.7.
	* Use a mark-and-sweep trimming algorithm to remove errors at the
	ends of blunt contigs.
	* The parallel (ABYSS-P) trimming algorithm is now deterministic;
	it will produce the same result every time. In addition, the
	result of the parallel trimming algorithm is identical to the
	result of the non-parallel trimming algorithm.
	* Start trimming branches at length 1, previously 2.
	* Bug fix in ABYSS-P. Repeat sequences of k-1 bases could
	potentially be misassembled. Use a mark-and-sweep algorithm to
	split ambiguous edges before contig generation. The previous
	algorithm was not deterministic.
	* Reduce memory usage by 200 MB by removing the MPI transmit
	buffer.
	* Bug fix in ABYSS-P. Fix an additional race condition in the
	erosion algorithm.

2009-03-24  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.6.
	* Bug fix. Fix a race condition in the erosion algorithm.
	* For the parallel program (ABYSS-P), after bubble popping perform
	as many trimming rounds as necessary to remove all the tips, as
	the non-parallel program does.
	* New script, abyss2afg, to create an AMOS AFG assembly.

2009-03-11  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.5.
	* Portability fixes. Tested with g++ 4.3.3.

2009-03-04  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.4.

	ABYSS:
	* Remove the need to specify a -e,--erode parameter by improving
	the erosion algorithm to complete in a single pass.
	* Remove the default limit on the maximum number of bubble
	popping rounds. A limit may be specified using -b,--bubbles.
	* Generate a warning if an input file is empty, but do not die.
	* When using a Google sparsehash, allocate room for 100 million
	k-mers.
	* Increase the maximum FASTA line length from 64 kB to 256 kB.
	* Require only one of either -l,--read-length or -t,--trim-length
	to be specified.
	* Allow read pairs to be named `_forward' and `_reverse'.
	* Ensure that exactly k-1 bases of context is given on each side
	of the bubble sequence. Previously, one side would have k bases of
	context, and the other side would have k-1 bases.
	* Add command line options to each of the paired-end programs.

	ABYSS-P:
	* Use Open MPI as the default MPI library.
	* Do not link against the Open MPI C++ library.

	abyss-pe:
	* Use pipes where possible to avoid intermediate files.
	* The semantics of the n argument have changed. See DistanceEst
	-n,--npairs below.

	SimpleGraph:
	* If more than one path is found but only one meets all of the
	constraints, use it.
	* Allow for some constant error in distance estimates that does
	not decrease with the number of samples. The expected fragment
	size seems to vary with genomic coordinate to a certain degree.
	So, the distribution of fragment size spanning two given contigs
	may differ from the empirical distribution by a roughly constant
	offset.

	DistanceEst:
	* The semantics of the -n,--npairs option has changed.
	Require at least NPAIRS pairs between contigs (>= NPAIRS).
	Previously, required strictly more than NPAIRS pairs between
	contigs (> NPAIRS).
	* Give the estimated error to a single decimal place.
	* When counting the number of pairs that join two contigs, only
	count pairs that fit the empirical distribution.
	* When deciding whether the pairs joining two contigs are
	inconsistent in sense, require NPAIRS read pairs joining two
	contigs in each sense before considering the pair data to be
	inconsistent.

	ParseAligns:
	* Measure fragments in total size, not alignment distance.
	* Allow a read that spans two contigs to be used in distance
	estimates.
	* Add the -h,--hist option to produce a histogram.
	* Bug fix. When measuring the empirical fragment size, ensure that
	the sense of the alignments is correct. Output a negative fragment
	size if the reverse read aligns ahead of the forward read.
	* Bug fix. Miscalculated the fragment size estimate between two
	contigs if they did not have the same sense and one contig
	required flipping. It was possible to see one distance estimate
	from contig A to contig B and a differing estimate from contig B
	to contig A. Typically, the distance estimate would be off by
	one.

2009-01-23  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.3.
	* Merge contigs that ended due to a lack of coverage, but which
	are connected by paired-end reads and overlap unambiguously.
	* Track the multiplicity the sense and antisense strand
	separately. Erode the end of a blunt contig until it is
	represented by both strands.
	* Ignore the case of the nucleotide sequence of a FASTA file.
	* Increase the maximum FASTA line length from 1 kB to 64 kB to
	allow loading contigs.
	* Output the path through the single-end contigs in the comment
	field of the paired-end contig.
	* In the paired-end driver script, abyss-pe,
	Implement a coverage cutoff, c.
	Pass the erosion parameter, e, to the single-end assembler.

2008-11-21  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.2.
	* Terminate contig extension at palindromic k-mers.
	* If erosion (-e,--erode) is enabled, remove the tips of blunt
	contigs that are represented only once.

2008-11-07  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.1.
	* Portability improvements to compile for Mac OS X.

2008-08-07  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.
