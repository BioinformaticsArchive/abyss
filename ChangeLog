	* Release version 1.0.3.
	* Merge contigs that ended due to a lack of coverage, but which
	are connected by paired-end reads and overlap unambiguously.
	* Track the multiplicity the sense and antisense strand
	separately. Erode the end of a blunt contig until it is
	represented by both strands.
	* Ignore the case of the nucleotide sequence of a FASTA file.
	* Increase the maximum FASTA line length from 1 kB to 64 kB to
	allow loading contigs.
	* Output the path through the single-end contigs in the comment
	field of the paired-end contig.
	* In the paired-end driver script, abyss-pe,
	Implement a coverage cutoff, c.
	Pass the erosion parameter, e, to the single-end assembler.

	* Terminate contig extension at palindromic k-mers.

	contigs that are represented only once.
