2009-03-24  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.6.
	* Bug fix. Fix a race condition in the erosion algorithm.
	* For the parallel program (ABYSS-P), after bubble popping perform
	as many trimming rounds as necessary to remove all the tips, as
	the non-parallel program does.
	* New script, abyss2afg, to create an AMOS AFG assembly.

2009-03-11  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.5.
	* Portability fixes. Tested with g++ 4.3.3.

	* Release version 1.0.4.

	ABYSS:
	* Remove the need to specify a -e,--erode parameter by improving
	the erosion algorithm to complete in a single pass.
	* Removet the default limit on the maximum number of bubble
	popping rounds. A limit may be specified using -b,--bubbles.
	* Generate a warning if an input file is empty, but do not die.
	* When using a Google sparsehash, allocate room for 100 million
	k-mers.
	* Increase the maximum FASTA line length from 64 kB to 256 kB.
	* Require only one of either -l,--read-length or -t,--trim-length
	to be specified.
	* Allow read pairs to be named `_forward' and `_reverse'.
	* Ensure that exactly k-1 bases of context is given on each side
	of the bubble sequence. Previously, one side would have k bases of
	context, and the other side would have k-1 bases.
	* Add command line options to each of the paired-end programs.

	ABYSS-P:
	* Use Open MPI as the default MPI library.
	* Do not link against the Open MPI C++ library.

	abyss-pe:
	* Use pipes where possible to avoid intermediate files.
	* The semantics of the n argument have changed. See DistanceEst
	-n,--npairs below.

	SimpleGraph:
	* If more than one path is found but only one meets all of the
	constraints, use it.
	* Allow for some constant error in distance estimates that does
	not decrease with the number of samples. The expected fragment
	size seems to vary with genomic coordinate to a certain degree.
	So, the distribution of fragment size spanning two given contigs
	may differ from the empirical distribution by a roughly constant
	offset.

	DistanceEst:
	* The semantics of the -n,--npairs option has changed.
	Require at least NPAIRS pairs between contigs (>= NPAIRS).
	Previously, required strictly more than NPAIRS pairs between
	contigs (> NPAIRS).
	* Give the estimated error to a single decimal place.
	* When counting the number of pairs that join two contigs, only
	count pairs that fit the empirical distribution.
	* When deciding whether the pairs joining two contigs are
	inconsistent in sense, require NPAIRS read pairs joining two
	contigs in each sense before considering the pair data to be
	inconsistent.

	ParseAligns:
	* Measure fragments in total size, not alignment distance.
	* Allow a read that spans two contigs to be used in distance
	estimates.
	* Add the -h,--hist option to produce a histogram.
	* Bug fix. When measuring the empirical fragment size, ensure that
	the sense of the alignments is correct. Output a negative fragment
	size if the reverse read aligns ahead of the forward read.
	* Bug fix. Miscalculated the fragment size estimate between two
	contigs if they did not have the same sense and one contig
	required flipping. It was possible to see one distance estimate
	from contig A to contig B and a differing estimate from contig B
	to contig A. Typically, the distance estimate would be off by
	one.

2009-01-23  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.3.
	* Merge contigs that ended due to a lack of coverage, but which
	are connected by paired-end reads and overlap unambiguously.
	* Track the multiplicity the sense and antisense strand
	separately. Erode the end of a blunt contig until it is
	represented by both strands.
	* Ignore the case of the nucleotide sequence of a FASTA file.
	* Increase the maximum FASTA line length from 1 kB to 64 kB to
	allow loading contigs.
	* Output the path through the single-end contigs in the comment
	field of the paired-end contig.
	* In the paired-end driver script, abyss-pe,
	Implement a coverage cutoff, c.
	Pass the erosion parameter, e, to the single-end assembler.

2008-11-21  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.2.
	* Terminate contig extension at palindromic k-mers.
	* If erosion (-e,--erode) is enabled, remove the tips of blunt
	contigs that are represented only once.

2008-11-07  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.1.
	* Portability improvements to compile for Mac OS X.

2008-08-07  Shaun Jackman  <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.
