ABySS - assemble short reads into contigs

* Compiling ABySS

Compiling ABySS should be as easy as
./configure && make

To install ABySS in a specified directory
./configure --prefix=/opt/ABySS && make && sudo make install

If you wish to build the parallel assembler with MPI support,
MPI should be found in /usr/include and /usr/lib or its location
specified to configure:
./configure --with-mpi=/usr/lib/openmpi && make

ABySS should be built using Google sparsehash to reduce memory usage,
although it will build without. Google sparsehash should be found in
/usr/include or its location specified to configure:
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

The default maximum k-mer size is 64 and may be decreased to reduce
memory usage or increased at compile time:
./configure --enable-maxk=96 && make

To run ABySS, its binaries should be found in your PATH.

* Single-end assembly

Assemble short reads in a file named reads.fa into contigs in a
file named contigs.fa with the following command:

ABYSS -k25 -l42 reads.fa

where -l specifies the read length and -k is an appropriate k-mer
length. The only method to find the optimal value of k is to run
multiple trials and inspect the results. The following shell snippet
will assemble for every value of k from 20 to 40.

for k in {20..40}; do
	ABYSS -k$k -l42 reads.fa -o contigs-k$k.fa
done

The maximum value for k is 64. This limit may be changed at compile
time using the --enable-maxk option of configure. It may be decreased
to 32 to decrease memory usage, which is particularly useful for large
parallel jobs, or increased to 96.

* Paired-end assembly

To assemble paired short reads in a file named reads.fa into contigs
in a file named paired-contigs.fa, run the command:

abyss-pe k=25 l=42 c=2 n=10 in='reads1.fa reads2.fa' lib=ecoli

where k and l are the k-mer length and read length as before.
c is the minimum average k-mer coverage of a contig and may be
disabled by setting c=0.
n is the minimum number of pairs needed to consider joining two
contigs. The optimal value for n must be found by trial.
in specifies the input files to read, which may be in FASTA, FASTQ,
qseq or export format and compressed with gz, bz2 or xz.
The assembled contigs will be stored in ${lib}-contigs.fa.

The suffix of the read identifier for a pair of reads must be one of
'1' and '2', or 'A' and 'B', or 'F' and 'R', or 'F3' and 'R3', or
'forward' and 'reverse'. The reads may be interleaved in the same file
or found in different files; however, interleaved mates will use less
memory.

abyss-pe is a driver script implemented as a Makefile and runs a
single-end assembly, as described above, and the following commands,
which must be found in your PATH:

ABYSS - the single-end assembler
AdjList - finds overlaps of length k-1 between contigs
KAligner - aligns reads to contigs
ParseAligns - finds pairs of reads in alignments
DistanceEst - estimates distances between contigs
Overlap - find overlaps between blunt contigs
SimpleGraph - finds paths between pairs of contigs
MergePaths - merges consistent paths
Consensus - for a colour-space assembly, convert the colour-space
            contigs to nucleotide contigs

* Parallel assembly

The `np' option of abyss-pe specifies the number of processes to
use for the ABYSS-P parallel MPI job. Without any MPI configuration,
this will allow you to make use of multiple cores on a single machine.
To use multiple machines for assembly, you must create a hostfile for
mpirun, which is describe in the mpirun man page.

The paired-end assembly runs on a single processor. For very large
jobs, a good portion of the paired-end assembly (KAligner,
ParseAligns, DistanceEst) may be run in parallel separate processes,
but this process is not automated by the driver script abyss-pe.

Open MPI integrates well with SGE (Sun Grid Engine). For example, to
submit an array of jobs to assemble every odd value of k between 51
and 63 using 64 processes for each job:

qsub -pe openmpi 64 -t 51-63:2 \
	mpirun ABYSS-P -k$SGE_TASK_ID -l75 reads.fa -o k$SGE_TASK_ID.fa

For more information on using SGE and qsub, please refer to the qsub
manual page. Open MPI must have been compiled with support for SGE
using the ./configure --with-sge option.

* Notes

The distribution of fragment sizes is calculated empirically by
aligning paired reads to the contigs produced by the single-end
assembler, and the distribution is stored in a file with the extension
.hist, such as ecoli-4.hist. The N50 of the single-end assembly must
be well over the fragment-size to obtain an accurate empirical
distribution.
