ABySS - assemble short reads into contigs

* Single-end assembly

Assemble short reads in a file named reads.fa into contigs in a
file named contigs.fa with the following command:

ABYSS -k25 -l42 reads.fa

where -l specifies the read length and -k is an appropriate k-mer
length. The only method to find the optimal value of k is to run
multiple trials and inspect the results. The following shell snippet
will assemble for every value of k from 20 to 40.

for k in {20..40}; do
	ABYSS -k$k -l42 reads.fa && mv contigs.fa contigs-k$k.fa
done

The maximum value for k is 64. This limit may be changed at compile
time using the --enable-maxk option of configure. It may be decreased
to 32 to decrease memory usage, which is particularly useful for large
parallel jobs, or increased to 96.

* Paired-end assembly

To assemble paired short reads in a file named reads.fa into contigs
in a file named paired-contigs.fa, run the command:

abyss-pe k=25 l=42 c=2 n=10 in='reads1.fa reads2.fa' lib=ecoli

where k and l are the k-mer length and read length as before.
c is the minimum average k-mer coverage of a contig and may be
disabled by setting c=0.
n is the minimum number of pairs needed to consider joining two
contigs. The optimal value for n must be found by trial.
in specifies the input files to read, which must be in either FASTA or
FASTQ format.
The assembled contigs will be stored in ${lib}-contigs.fa.

The last character of the read identifier for a pair of reads must be
one of '1' and '2', or 'A' and 'B', or 'F' and 'R'.

abyss-pe is a driver script implemented as a Makefile and runs a
single-end assembly, as described above, and the following commands,
which must be found in your PATH:

ABYSS - the single-end assembler
AdjList - finds overlaps of length k-1 between contigs
KAligner - aligns reads to contigs
ParseAligns - finds pairs of reads in alignments
DistanceEst - estimates distances between contigs
Overlap - find overlaps between blunt contigs
SimpleGraph - finds paths between pairs of contigs
MergePaths - merges consistent paths

* Notes

The distribution of fragment sizes is calculated empirically by
aligning paired reads to the contigs produced by the single-end
assembler, and the distribution is stored in a file with the extension
.hist, such as reads.hist.
